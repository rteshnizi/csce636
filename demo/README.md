I have trained 3 different networks with different hyperparamters, all 3 of which fail to produce the expected results.

Below are the URLs to download the required tensorflow session checkpoint files for each network.
You need to place the following 4 files in this directory: `checkpoint`, `model.ckpt.index`, `model.ckpt.meta`, `model.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001`.
